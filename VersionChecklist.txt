Added:
Changed configuration options for wings. Toggles are now strictly to denote if you own
the associated artifact wings.
The wing commands option is strictly for those who like to store their wings when not in use "get wings from pack\wear wings\say duanathar\remove wings\put wings in pack"
    Do not change this if you are an air lord (see below).
Exits are now clickable on the map GUI. Image showing worm warp or enter grate
Pierce the veil logic is now integrated automatically when in or not in dragonform
Aero Soar for air lords is now integrated automatically when in or not in air lord. 
    Will always use wings over aero if toggle is enabled, but still calculate for stratosphere.
Changed mouse over labels to room names instead of room number.
The crowd map had numerous exits with mudlet scripts built in; translated all but two.
